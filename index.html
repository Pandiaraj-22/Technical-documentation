        <p><h1>JavaScript</h1>
            JavaScript (JS) is the most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. It can be used for both Client-side as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript also known as a scripting language for web pages.Reason to Learn JavaScript
            JavaScript is used by many developers (65% of the total development community), and the number is increasing day by day. JavaScript is one such programming language that has more than 1444231 libraries and increasing rapidly.
            It is preferred over any other programming language by most developers. Also, major tech companies like Microsoft, Uber, Google, Netflix, and Meta use JavaScript in their projects. To learn more reasons, please refer Reasons to Learn JavaScript article.
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produce output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call that function. 
            To create a function in JavaScript, we have to first use the keyword function, separated by the name of the function and parameters within parenthesis. The part of the function inside the curly braces {} is the body of the function.

In javascript, functions can be used in the same way as variables for assignments, or calculations.

Function Definition: Before, using a user-defined function in JavaScript we have to create one. We can use the above syntax to create a function in JavaScript. A function definition is sometimes also termed a function declaration or function statement. Below are the rules for creating a function in JavaScript:

Every function should begin with the keyword function followed by,
A user-defined function name that should be unique,
A list of parameters enclosed within parentheses and separated by commas,
A list of statements composing the body of the function enclosed within curly braces {}.
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            Method definitions are not constructable
Methods cannot be constructors! They will throw a TypeError if you try to instantiate them. On the other hand, a property created as a function can be used as a constructor.
Using super in method definitions
Only functions defined as methods have access to the super keyword. super.prop looks up the property on the prototype of the object that the method was initialized on.
Method definitions in classes
You can use the exact same syntax to define public instance methods that are available on class instances. In classes, you don't need the comma separator between methods.
Public instance methods are defined on the prototype property of the class and are thus shared by all instances of the class. They are writable, non-enumerable, and configurable.

Inside instance methods, this and super work like in normal methods. Usually, this refers to the instance itself. In subclasses, super lets you access the prototype of the object that the method is attached to, allowing you to call methods from the superclass.
